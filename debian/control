Description: OCaml bindings for libvirt (runtime)
 This library provides OCaml bindings for using libvirt.
 .
 Libvirt is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of
 recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). The library aims at providing
 a long term stable C API for different virtualization mechanisms. It
 currently supports QEMU, KVM, and XEN.
